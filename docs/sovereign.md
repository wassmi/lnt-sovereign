# Sovereign Grade (SG-1 & SG-2)

Sovereign Grade is a set of performance and security standards implemented in the LNT engine to support mission-critical AI applications.

## 🥇 SG-1: The Symbolic Cage
*   **Relationship Logic**: Prerequisites ensure context is met before deeper logic is evaluated.
*   **Weighted Manifold**: Not all rules are equal. SG-1 supports weightings from 0.0 to 1.0.
*   **Vectorized Proofs**: BELM ensures 10k rules are evaluated in < 3ms.

## 🥈 SG-2: Temporal Awareness
*   **Sliding Windows**: Support for `trailing_average` and `event_frequency`.
*   **Contextual Persistence**: The engine remembers history across spans from milliseconds to months.
*   **Delta Checks**: Detection of rapid state changes (micro-temporal) for cyber-security and ICU monitoring.
