# ADR 001: Vectorized Symbolic Manifolds (BELM)
**Date:** 2026-01-22  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context
AI validation typically relies on "LLM-as-a-Judge" or recursive neural evaluation. This introduces:
1.  **Latency**: Stochastic models require significant compute relative to verification.
2.  **Inconsistency**: Probabilistic validation cannot provide mathematical guarantees.
3.  **Cost**: High token overhead for internal reasoning traces.

## Decision
We implement the **Bilateral Evaluation Logic Manifold (BELM)**. BELM projects symbolic constraints into a flattened matrix format, utilizing JIT-compiled SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for parallel evaluation.

## Rationale
*   **Determinism**: Symbolic logic ensures that for any input $X$, the result $f(X)$ is constant and provable.
*   **Performance**: Vectorization allows LNT to scale to 10,000+ rules with sub-3ms latency, a 100x improvement over neural-only guardrails.
*   **Auditability**: The flattened structure allows for bit-perfect cryptographic hashing of the entire decision path.

## Consequences
*   **Pros**: Ultra-low latency, mathematical certainty, compliant audit trails.
*   **Cons**: Requires structured proposals (signals must be parsed from text before logic evaluation).
